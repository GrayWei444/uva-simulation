Standard LED lighting often lacks the UV wavelengths necessary for the targeted stimulation of specific biosynthetic pathways, leading to poor coloration. This study aimed to develop and validate a systematic, two-stage \"screening-to-optimization\" research framework to establish precise UVA lighting strategies that enhance anthocyanin in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) while maintaining biomass. The initial Comparative Screening stage confirmed that while UVB (302 nm) irradiation potently induced anthocyanin (up to 85% increase) , it activated damaging stress responses, causing severe photodamage and significant yield loss across four cultivars. In contrast, UVA (365 nm) light effectively promoted coloration (40-60% increase) without negatively impacting fresh weight, likely by engaging specific photoreceptor-mediated signaling pathways without triggering excessive stress. \'Lollo Rosso\', identified as the most resilient and responsive cultivar, advanced to the Targeted Optimization stage. Here, an optimized protocol---6 hours/day for 6 days (UVA-L6D6)---significantly increased its anthocyanin and total phenol content by 65% and 48%, respectively, with a fresh weight statistically comparable to the control group. The key novel outcome of this work is the validation of a data-driven methodology that successfully navigates the growth-quality trade-off by selectively activating quality-enhancing metabolic pathways. This research not only provides a commercially viable protocol for \'Lollo Rosso\' but, more importantly, offers a reliable and efficient framework for developing cultivar-specific lighting recipes for other specialty crops in CEA. **Keywords:** UVA radiation, Red leaf lettuce, Anthocyanin biosynthesis, Controlled environment agriculture, LED supplemental lighting, Secondary metabolites, Photoreceptors, Light signaling, Cryptochrome, Cultivar-specific response, Screening-to-optimization methodology, Phenolic compounds. 1\. Introduction Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a popular vegetable valued for its rich content of protein, vitamin C, minerals, carotenes, and chlorophyll. It also contains lactucarium, an important substance with anti-cancer potential noted for its role in preventing cancers of the liver and stomach, establishing it as a premier anti-cancer vegetable. Among its many varieties, red lettuce is distinguished by its anthocyanin-rich red leaves, making it an indispensable component for adding color to salads and a vegetable of high nutritional value. A study by Lee, J. H., et al. (2009) found that red lettuce may contribute to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Light is arguably the most critical environmental signal influencing a plant\'s entire life cycle (Paik & Huq, 2019). Plants perceive light using a suite of photoreceptors which translate light signals into biological responses. These include phytochromes, the primary sensors for red and far-red light that regulate processes like germination and shade avoidance; cryptochromes, which perceive blue and UVA light and are critical for photomorphogenesis and the upregulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (Goyal et al., 2013); and the UVR8 photoreceptor, a specific sensor for UVB radiation that triggers protective stress-response pathways. The activation of these photoreceptors, particularly cryptochromes, can lead to the stabilization of key transcription factors like ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), which in turn promotes the expression of genes essential for anthocyanin synthesis (Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020). This light-induced accumulation is a natural defense mechanism against stressors (Rozema et al., 1997) and is the biological basis for using specific light wavelengths to enhance crop quality. However, the cultivation of lettuce in subtropical climates, such as that of Taiwan, faces challenges, with poor summer growth restricting cultivation primarily to the winter months. Consequently, a substantial portion of lettuce is imported, leading to higher consumer prices and contradicting the principle of food miles. The cultivation of lettuce and other leafy greens in Plant Factories with Artificial Lighting (PFALs), which offer precise environmental control, can facilitate year-round production with stable quantity and price. While the primary light sources in PFALs, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), provide excellent energy efficiency, their standard spectrum typically lacks the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths found in natural sunlight. This spectral deficiency impedes the proper color development of red leaf lettuce in these facilities. The coloration of plants and their synthesis of secondary metabolites are primarily defense mechanisms against environmental stress, with solar UV radiation being a direct and effective stressor (Stapleton, 1992; Tevini & Teramura, 1989). Numerous studies have confirmed that supplemental UV radiation is an effective tool for inducing the accumulation of anthocyanins and other secondary metabolites (Tsormpatsidis et al., 2009). However, the application of stress is a double-edged sword; while it can enhance quality, it may also inhibit plant growth. For instance, early studies on other crops, such as cucumber, indicated that solar UVA and UVB radiation could significantly decrease fresh and dry weight, highlighting a potential trade-off (Krizek et al., 1997). This highlights the complexity of UV application, which is contingent on wavelength specificity. The distinct roles of different UV wavebands are critical. While Martin et al. (2023) noted that supplemental UVB increased flavonoid and anthocyanin concentrations, recent comparative studies consistently show that higher-energy UVB often causes more significant growth inhibition in some studies. In contrast, UVA is considered a more moderate and controllable regulatory tool. This aligns with findings from Li and Kubota (2009), who reported that UVA and blue light could increase the anthocyanin content of \'Red Cross\' lettuce. Similarly, Lee et al. (2022) found that brief pre-harvest exposure to UVA enhanced the nutritional quality of lettuce. Beyond wavelength, the plant\'s response is also governed by genotypic specificity. A study by Paulina et al. (2007) on \'Lollo Rosso\' lettuce discovered that UV irradiation induced a substantial accumulation of anthocyanins. This suggests that responses can be cultivar-specific, a finding explicitly confirmed by recent work showing significant genotypic variation in lettuce\'s response to UVA (??rias et al., 2023). Recognizing these complexities, researchers have begun to develop optimization strategies. For example, Lycoskoufis et al. (2022) developed a strategy involving a UV-blocking film supplemented with UV light for 10 days before harvest to increase fresh weight while maintaining equivalent quality. Dynamic supplementation strategies are also being explored (Choi et al., 2024). Based on the foregoing literature, it is evident that a \'one-size-fits-all\' approach is inadequate for leveraging UV light to enhance crop quality. A systematic framework is required to navigate the complexities of wavelength and genotype specificity in UV research. Therefore, this study aims to propose and validate a two-stage \"screening-to-optimization\" approach. In the first stage (Screening), we will compare UVA and UVB across multiple cultivars to identify a safe, effective waveband and a resilient, responsive cultivar. In the second stage (Optimization), we will subject the selected candidate to various UVA irradiation protocols to identify a strategy that enhances coloration and secondary metabolites without compromising fresh weight. The ultimate goal is to validate this two-stage approach as a systematic methodology for determining the most suitable, cultivar-specific UVA irradiation strategy for application in PFALS. 2\. Materials and Methods 2.1 General Cultivation Environment and Equipment All experiments in this study were conducted in a controlled environment chamber at the Department of Biomechatronics Engineering, National Taiwan University. The cultivation system consisted of a four-tier rack with a shared circulating hydroponic system, ensuring identical nutrient conditions across all experimental groups. Environmental parameters during the cultivation period were set as follows: day/night temperatures were maintained at 25/20 ?¡Ó 1 ?¢XC, relative humidity was controlled at 60 ?¡Ó 10%, and the carbon dioxide concentration was maintained at 1000 ?¡Ó 200 ppm. The nutrient solution used was Hyponex No. 1, with its electrical conductivity (EC) and pH maintained at 1.2 mS?¡Pcm????? and 6.5, respectively. Primary illumination was provided by T8 LED tubes (Epistar, Hsinchu, Taiwan), with a photoperiod of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark. The Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) was maintained at 130 ??mol?¡Pm??????¡Ps????? at a distance of 25 cm below the lamps, as measured with a light meter (LI-250A, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). The specifications of the LED light quality are detailed in Table 1, and its spectrum is shown in Figure 1. The complete cultivation rack is depicted in Figure 2. Other instruments include an electronic balance (C9AS-ATX224R, Shimadzu, Japan), a colorimeter (NE-4000, Nippon Denshoku, Tokyo, Japan), and a spectrophotometer (PRO-7990, Prema, Taiwan). > Table 1.

On day 32 post-sowing, UV light treatments were initiated. The experiment consisted of three groups, with detailed irradiation conditions provided in Table 2: UVA group: Irradiated with UVA for 4 hours daily for 3 days. UVB group: Irradiated with UVB for 4 hours daily for 3 days. Control group: Received no UV radiation. All plants were harvested on day 35 post-sowing for analysis. Each treatment group consisted of five biological replicates. Table 2.

The vertical distance from the lamps to the surface of the cultivation shelf was fixed at 25 cm, providing a mean irradiance of 1004 ??W/cm^2^ at the plant canopy level. UVB Source: Sankyo Denki germicidal lamps (Sankyo Denki, Kanagawa, Japan) were used, with a peak wavelength of 302 nm and a radiant power of approximately 1510 ??W/cm??.

Seeds were sown in water-saturated sponge media and germinated under continuous LED illumination at a PPFD of 100 ??mol?¡Pm??????¡Ps?????. After approximately 6 days, once the cotyledons had fully expanded, seedlings were transplanted to the cultivation rack on day 14 post-sowing. All plants were harvested on day 35 post-sowing for growth analysis. 2.3.2 Treatment Design and UVA Irradiation Protocols This experiment utilized the same UVA and LED light sources as Experiment 1, with the LED PPFD distribution shown in Figure 4. Detailed strategies are provided in Table 3, and a schematic of the dynamic irradiation strategies is presented in Figure 5. ![](media/image8.tiff){width="4.447222222222222in" height="2.5in"} Figure 4.

Schematic diagram of the dynamic UVA irradiation strategies for the UVA-SIN (Sinusoidal) and UVA-INT (Intermittent) treatments in Experiment 2. 2.4 Data Measurement and Analysis Methods 2.4.1 Fresh Weight and Morphology Immediately after harvest, the root systems and sponge media were excised, and the fresh weight of the aerial portions was measured using an electronic balance. The morphology of each treatment group was documented with a digital camera. 2.4.2 Leaf Color Analysis On day 35 of cultivation, a fully expanded, mature leaf was selected from the central part of each plant. A colorimeter (Nippon Denshoku, Japan) was used to measure the CIE L\*, a\*, and b\* values at three points (top, middle, and bottom) on the adaxial leaf surface, and these values were averaged. 2.4.3 Anthocyanin Content Analysis Following a modified method from Hung et al. (2008), a 0.5 g leaf sample was randomly collected from each treatment. To ensure homogeneity, samples were taken from the middle section of the leaf, excluding the main vein. The sample was ground in a mortar and homogenized with 2 mL of potassium phosphate buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,600 ?¡X g for 30 minutes at 4?¢XC (Universal 320 R, Hettich, Germany). The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. This modified method was selected for its simplicity and high throughput, which was particularly advantageous for the initial screening phase of our study involving numerous samples. While it is not a traditional absolute quantification method, it has proven to be a rapid and reliable technique for determining the relative changes in anthocyanin content between treatments. As our goal was to identify the best-performing protocol relative to the control, this method was highly suitable for our screening-to-optimization framework. 2.4.4 Total Phenol Content Analysis A 0.5 g leaf sample was ground to a fine powder in a mortar with liquid nitrogen and subsequently dissolved in 5 mL of methanol. The mixture was allowed to stand for 24 hours to create an extract. An aliquot of 0.25 mL of the extract was mixed with 0.25 mL of 50% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and incubated for 3 minutes at 25 ?¢XC. Following this, 0.5 mL of 10% Na~2~CO~3~ and 4 mL of deionized water were added. After 1 hour, the absorbance was measured at 735 nm. Gallic acid was used as a standard to generate a calibration curve. Quantification was performed using this curve, and the results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) in ppm on a fresh weight basis. 2.5 Statistical Analysis In this study, both Experiment 1 (Screening) and Experiment 2 (Optimization) included n=5 biological replicates per treatment group. All data are presented as mean ?¡Ó standard deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by Tukey\'s HSD post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. A p-value of \< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). 3\. Results **3.1 Experiment 1: Comparative Screening of Lettuce Cultivars under UVA and UVB** **Radiation** **3.1.1 Morphology and Fresh Weight** Significant morphological differences were observed among the treatment groups after UV irradiation (Figure 6). The UVB treatment caused visible necrosis and damage to the leaves of all cultivars, with the most severe effects observed on \'Champagne Red Flame\', though the plants remained viable. In contrast, the UVA treatment effectively induced red coloration in all four cultivars without observable photodamage. The control group remained predominantly green. The quantitative fresh weight data (Figure 7) supported these visual observations. Compared to the control and UVA groups, the UVB treatment significantly reduced the aerial fresh weight of all four tested cultivars. Conversely, no statistically significant difference in fresh weight was observed between the UVA treatment group and the control group. ![](media/image10.png){width="5.4556277340332455in" height="3.0684711286089237in"} \(a\) ![](media/image11.tiff){width="5.429084645669291in" height="2.870080927384077in"} \(b\) Figure 6.

Notably, in some severely damaged cultivars, the UVB treatment led to a significant increase in the b\* value (yellowness), corresponding to symptoms of necrosis. ![](media/image14.png){width="5.440030621172354in" height="3.059951881014873in"} \(a\) ![](media/image16.png){width="5.446399825021873in" height="3.0635345581802276in"} \(b\) ![](media/image18.png){width="5.310673665791776in" height="2.986942257217848in"} \(c\) Figure 8.

Different letters above the bars indicate significant differences according to Tukey\'s HSD test (p \< 0.05). **3.1.3 Anthocyanin Content** The analysis of anthocyanin content (Figure 9) revealed that the UVB-treated group had the highest concentration, followed by the UVA-treated group, while the control group had the lowest. It is important to note that the sample from the \'Champagne Red Flame\' cultivar under UVB showed extremely low values. This is likely an artifact resulting from severe tissue necrosis that impeded efficient pigment extraction, rather than a genuine inhibition of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Based on these results, the \'Lollo Rosso\' cultivar was selected for the subsequent optimization experiment. ![](media/image19.png){width="5.363596894138233in" height="3.016958661417323in"} Figure 9.

The analysis of fresh weight (Figure 11) showed that the UVA-L6D6 and UVA-L6D6-N treatments did not result in a significant difference in fresh weight compared to the CK group. In contrast, all other UVA treatments led to a significant decrease in fresh weight. ![](media/image21.png){width="5.433622047244095in" height="3.056347331583552in"} \(a\) ![](media/image23.png){width="5.51462489063867in" height="3.1019105424321958in"} \(b\) Figure 10.

Discussion** 4.1 Insights from the Screening Phase: High Risk of UVB and Cultivar-Specific Potential of UVA The results of our first experiment clearly reveal the fundamental differences in the application of UVA and UVB radiation. Although UVB proved to be a potent elicitor of anthocyanin synthesis, its high photon energy led to severe growth inhibition and photodamage across all tested cultivars. This finding is consistent with previous research concluding that UVB often results in significant yield loss in many studies. This damaging effect is directly linked to the activation of the UVR8 photoreceptor, which initiates a strong, systemic stress response intended for survival under harsh conditions but is detrimental to biomass accumulation in a production context. In contrast, UVA acted as a more moderate stress signal, effectively promoting coloration without causing significant yield loss, thereby demonstrating its potential as a tool for precision quality control. More importantly, this initial phase highlighted the \"genotypic specificity\" of plant responses. The different cultivars exhibited varied tolerance to UVB and differing efficiencies in coloration under UVA. This observation corroborates the findings of ??rias et al. (2023) and underscores the inadequacy of a \'one-size-fits-all\' lighting recipe. It is worth noting that while quantitative data provides an objective measure, visual perception of plant size and color can be influenced by multiple morphological factors. For instance, although \'Purple Romaine\' appeared larger in representative images (Figure 7) due to its broader leaf morphology, its leaf count was lower, resulting in a fresh weight approximately 70% that of \'Lollo Rosso\'. Consequently, while its anthocyanin concentration was high, the lower biomass led to a lower total anthocyanin content per plant, highlighting the importance of integrating biomass into the overall evaluation. 4.2 Plausible Mechanisms and the Growth-Quality Trade-off In the second phase of our study, we observed a classic \"growth-quality trade-off.\" While the high-dose UVA-H12D3 treatment yielded the highest concentration of anthocyanins and phenolics, it came at the cost of significantly reduced biomass. This highlights a fundamental principle in plant physiology: a stress signal strong enough to maximize secondary metabolite concentration often over-saturates the plant\'s acclimation capacity, leading to growth inhibition. For this reason, we selected total content per plant as the primary metric for defining the optimal protocol. This choice is based on both commercial and nutritional grounds, as the final marketable product is the whole plant, and consumer benefit is derived from the total nutrients ingested per serving. This trade-off can be interpreted through the lens of known plant light signaling pathways, which differ based on the energy of the perceived wavelength. As noted, high-energy UVB radiation is perceived by the UVR8 photoreceptor, which triggers a robust stress-signaling cascade that, while protective, is often detrimental to growth (Jenkins, 2017). In contrast, the positive effects of UVA are mediated by a separate, more regulatory pathway. UVA is perceived by photoreceptors such as cryptochromes (CRY) (Goyal et al., 2013). Upon activation by UVA photons, cryptochromes are understood to interact with and suppress the function of the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which in darkness targets the central light-signaling transcription factor, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), for degradation (Liu et al., 2011). The resulting accumulation of HY5 in the nucleus acts as a master switch, directly binding to the promoters of and upregulating numerous genes involved in photomorphogenesis and secondary metabolism (Chen et al., 2021). Crucially, this includes the structural genes of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, such as Chalcone Synthase (CHS) and Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) (Liu et al., 2020; An et al., 2021). Therefore, our optimized UVA-L6D6 protocol likely landed in an \"optimal operating window.\" It provided a sufficient and sustained signal to activate the UVA -\> CRY -\> HY5 -\> Anthocyanin Genes cascade, significantly boosting secondary metabolite content. However, the dose was moderate enough to avoid the level of oxidative stress that would reallocate excessive energy away from biomass production. This allows for an increase in quality without a prohibitive penalty to growth, a finding consistent with recent reports that moderate-intensity continuous UVA can improve lettuce quality without growth inhibition (Kim & Kim, 2022). 4.3 Methodological Contribution and Practical Implications This study also compared different irradiation patterns and timings. The finding that nighttime irradiation (UVA-L6D6-N) produced results that were not significantly different from daytime irradiation (UVA-L6D6) offers greater flexibility for production management, potentially allowing growers to utilize off-peak electricity hours. We hypothesize that the rest periods in the intermittent treatment may allow the plants to partially recover from the light stress, leading to slightly lower anthocyanin induction. However, this mechanism requires future investigation to be confirmed. In summary, the core contribution of this study lies not only in providing an optimized UVA lighting protocol but, more importantly, in proposing and validating a systematic, two-stage \"screening-to-optimization\" research methodology. This approach, which successfully identifies a treatment that balances the activation of specific quality-enhancing signaling pathways with the avoidance of generalized growth-inhibiting stress, responds to the call for more systematic research approaches in controlled environment agriculture in various studies. Therefore, not only does this study provide a commercially viable technical protocol for enhancing the quality of \'Lollo Rosso\' lettuce, but its \"screening-to-optimization\" framework also serves as a valuable template for the development of customized lighting recipes for other high-value specialty crops. 5\. Conclusions This study proposed and validated a systematic, two-stage research framework for developing a precise UV lighting strategy that balances crop quality and yield. The results of the first stage (comparative screening) confirmed that UVB radiation entails higher risks due to its significant negative impact on biomass, likely mediated by the UVR8 stress-response pathway. In contrast, UVA was identified as a safer and more promising tool for quality regulation. Concurrently, this initial phase successfully identified \'Lollo Rosso\' lettuce as the candidate cultivar with the most potential for optimization. Based on these screening results, the second stage of targeted optimization successfully identified an optimal UVA irradiation protocol: a treatment of 6 hours per day for 6 days (the UVA-L6D6 treatment). This protocol was shown to effectively enhance the red coloration of the lettuce and significantly increase its anthocyanin and total phenol content, all without a significant impact on fresh weight. This study further confirmed that the daily cumulative UVA dose is the core factor modulating this growth-quality trade-off, likely by activating the cryptochrome-mediated HY5 signaling pathway to a sufficient degree to enhance secondary metabolism without inducing growth-inhibiting stress. In summary, this research not only provides a concrete and commercially viable lighting recipe for enhancing the quality of red lettuce, but its more significant contribution lies in the successful demonstration of a data-driven, \"screening-to-optimization\" methodology. This research framework provides a scientific, efficient, and reliable template for the future development of customized lighting recipes for other high-value specialty crops. Future research should explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses more directly. We propose that techniques such as RT-qPCR could be used to quantify the expression levels of key regulatory (HY5) and structural (CHS, DFR) genes to provide direct molecular evidence for the proposed pathway. Additionally, investigating changes in chlorophyll content and the activity of key enzymes like phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) could further optimize crop quality and color perception.
